    "content": "As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to external documents, including a specific Table of Contents (TOC), to provide actual questions. However, I can guide you on how to create or choose questions based on common algebra topics typically found in sections 1.2 and 1.3 of algebra textbooks. Since we are looking for easy questions and any learning objective is fine, I'll provide examples that reflect common themes in these sections.### For Section 1.2: Basic Algebraic Operations**Question 1: Simplify the Expression**   - Prompt: Simplify the following expression: \\(3x + 2x - 5x\\).   - Answer: \\(0\\).**Question 2: Solving Simple Equations**   - Prompt: Solve the equation for \\(x\\): \\(2x + 3 = 9\\).   - Answer: \\(x = 3\\).### For Section 1.3: Working with Fractions and Decimals**Question 3: Adding Fractions**   - Prompt: Add the following fractions and simplify the result: \\(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\).   - Answer: \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).**Question 4: Converting Decimals to Fractions**   - Prompt: Convert the decimal \\(0.75\\) to a fraction.   - Answer: \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).These examples are designed to target basic comprehension and procedural skills in algebra, suitable for an easy difficulty level. When creating or selecting your questions, ensure they are aligned with the learning objectives of sections 1.2 and 1.3 as defined by your curriculum or textbook. If you need more specific examples or different types of questions, feel free to ask!",
