Once we progress through the steps of creating a mock exam, including discussing chapters, sections, learning objectives, and difficulty levels, we will be able to accumulate insights and lessons learned based on our interaction. These learnings could involve the efficiency of our communication, the effectiveness of the exam preparation process, or even how well the selected questions align with the provided criteria.
