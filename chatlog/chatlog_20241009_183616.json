Let me summarize the steps I'll take to assist you:I'll review the Table of Contents document to identify easy questions related to Section 1.2 and 1.3.From the identification, I'll select two questions that align with general learning objectives for these sections.Let's proceed with selecting the questions. Since I'm operating in a hypothetical scenario and can't access real-time or live databases or documents, I'll create example questions based on common algebra topics often found in Section 1.2 and 1.3 in many algebra textbooks. ### Question 1 (Section 1.2 - Basic Algebraic Manipulations)Question: Solve for \\(x\\) in the equation \\(3x + 5 = 14\\).Answer: \\(3x + 5 = 14\\)  \\(3x = 14 - 5\\)  \\(3x = 9\\)  \\(x = 3\\)### Question 2 (Section 1.3 - Solving Simple Equations)Question: Find the value of \\(y\\) when \\(2y - 4 = 10\\).Answer: \\(2y - 4 = 10\\)  \\(2y = 10 + 4\\)  \\(2y = 14\\)  \\(y = 7\\)These questions should be suitably easy for an introductory level of algebra, focusing on fundamental algebraic manipulations and solving simple equations. Would you like to include these questions in your mock exam, or is there anything else you'd like to adjust?",
